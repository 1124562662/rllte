**RLLTE** is committed to achieve the goal of "RL for Everyone". Therefore, we develop a copilot to help you use the framework more efficiently. This copilot is 
built based on [LocalGPT](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT) and [Vicuna-7B](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3) of [LMSYS](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/), which can answer any questions (e.g., algorithm theory, training, and programming.) about RL.
