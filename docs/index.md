# **RLLTE: Long-Term Evolution Project of Reinforcement Learning**



---

Inspired by the long-term evolution (LTE) standard project in telecommunications, aiming to provide development components for and standards for advancing RL research and applications. Beyond delivering top-notch algorithm implementations, **RLLTE** also serves as a **toolkit** for developing algorithms.

An introduction to RLLTE.
</div>

## **Why RLLTE?**
- 🧬 Long-term evolution for providing latest algorithms and tricks;
- 🏞️ Complete ecosystem for task design, model training, evaluation, and deployment (TensorRT, CANN, ...);
- 🧱 Module-oriented design for complete decoupling of RL algorithms;
- 🚀 Optimized workflow for full hardware acceleration;
- ⚙️ Support custom environments and modules;
- 🖥️ Support multiple computing devices like GPU and NPU;
- 💾 Large number of reusable benchmarks (See [rllte-hub](https://hub.rllte.dev));
- 👨‍✈️ Large language model-empowered copilot.

## **A `PyTorch` for RL**
RLLTE decouples RL algorithms into minimum primitives and provide standard modules for development. 

See [Fast Algorithm Development]() for detailed examples.
